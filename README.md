# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?

I wanted a change of career, direction, and an overall better outlook to my future.

- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")

I made this project as a start to a new learning experience and my interests in this career path.

- What problem does it solve?

Technology is evolving quickly as time goes by and I am here to learn with it.

- What did you learn?

I rediscovered some coding terms and have also added to the ones I've already known. In addition, I've learned about what each part of a web application does so when I go to any website, I can understand how each part was used effectively.

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)

## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:

![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)

This web application is a guide for those who are starting and/or taking an interest into coding. It contains references to the 3 main languages that coders use and an easy-to-use site which is HTML (HyperText Markup Language), CSS (Cascasing Style Sheets), JavaScript, and Git. There will be explanations or terminology of each language under their respective locations. The purposes of this guide can be used for future referencing .

Could be used as a future reference guide in case of reeducation or certain topics.

Can continually be added onto as a space for note taking to look back on when in need to code/debug/reference or personal use.

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

Please refer to the LICENSE in the repo.

## Badges

![badmath](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/nielsenjared/badmath)

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
