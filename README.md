# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

- What was your motivation?

I wanted a change of career, direction, and an overall better outlook to my future.

- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")

I made this project as a start to a new learning experience and my interests in this career path.

- What problem does it solve?

Technology is evolving quickly as time goes by and I am here to learn with it.

- What did you learn?

I rediscovered some coding terms and have also added to the ones I've already known. In addition, I've learned about what each part of a web application does so when I go to any website, I can understand how each part was used effectively.
